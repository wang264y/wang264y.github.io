excerpt: 'Stock market predictions have been prominent among scholars. Sentiment analysis
applying financial news articles for predicting stock has also grown in popularity over
the past few decades. Our research indicates the impact of sentiment analysis of financial
news on forecasting asset prices. In this research, sentiment is culled from financial news
of companies over the past three years. Subsequently the asset prices can be predicted
using stock market data, alongside sentiment analysis data with several machine
learning algorithms. The results show a more convincing level of precision in the
aggregation of both stock market data and sentiment analysis data.'

Below are some interesting projects I have completed in the past few years, some of them are final projects in different courses I took. 

## Exploratory Network Analysis on the Chinese A-share Stock Market

I have completed this project during the Data Mining (SI 671) course at University of Michigan in Fall 2023 with Junyi Deng. 

**Abstract:** This project investigates the dynamics of the Chinese A-share stock market from January 2021 to December 2022. Utilizing the “baostock” library and network analysis, we explore the relationships between stocks and the dynamic of the stock correlation network across different industry sectors, particularly during the implementation of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in 2022. Our results reveal a general decreasing trend in index closing prices, negatively correlated with interest rate hikes. The correlation network analysis indicates a nuanced negative correlation between Return on Investment (ROI) and the interest rate hike, observed through a shift in node colors. Also, stocks within the same sector exhibit higher correlations, emphasizing the significance of sectoral considerations in portfolio management.

**Deliverables:** [report]("files/SI671_report.pdf") and [poster]("files/SI671_poster.pdf") 

## Investigation on the News Representations of Chinese International Students

I have completed this project as my Data Science Capstone project during Spring 2023 semester at Mount Holyoke College. 

**Abstract:** China has traditionally been the primary contributor of international students to the US, a topic frequently discussed in US media. However, the global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Chinese students studying in the US, altering how they are depicted in news coverage. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the portrayal of Chinese international students in US news. It employed structural topic modeling and sentiment analysis to identify shifts in topics and sentiments before and after the pandemic. The findings revealed notable changes in news topics, shifting from a focus on academics and education pre-pandemic to addressing challenges and stress post-pandemic. Surprisingly, sentiment changes were less discernible. This study delves into the differences in news representations of Chinese international students pre- and post-COVID-19, offering valuable insights for universities to enhance their policies and resources for this demographic.

## Docker Data Science Environment Development

I have completed this project in Spring 2023 semester at Mount Holyoke College. This project is a simplified version of the main branch project of a Dockerized environment. Specifically, this project provides a starting template of a Dockerized environment for R users, which can be extended. This project is completed by Susan Wang, an undergraduate student of the Class of 2023 from Mount Holyoke College, as a Portfolio project. For more information or a Docker contain with Python, R and Julia, please refer to the [MHC docker-data-science-environment repository]("https://github.com/mtholyoke/docker-data-science-environment").

**Deliverables:** [Github repo]("https://github.com/wang264y/docker-data-science-environment")
